## ‚ú® Features

- **Dynamic Flashcards**:  
  Users can navigate through a set of vocabulary cards, each featuring an English word, its transcription, and its translation. Cards are displayed one at a time to mimic traditional flashcards, with a "Check" button to reveal the translation. Clicking the translation toggles back to the "Check" button, encouraging active recall.

- **CRUD Table for Word Management**:  
  A dedicated table enables users to manage their vocabulary dynamically. Words can be added with real-time validation to ensure no field is left empty, edited to update existing entries, and deleted when no longer needed.

- **Progress Tracking**:  
  The app tracks the number of words users have learned. Progress is displayed prominently, motivating users to continue learning and achieve their language goals.

- **Responsive Design**:
  Built with mobile-first principles, the app ensures a seamless experience across devices, allowing users to learn on the go.
